# mu-lang

Scripting language designed to communicate with java, to allow for easy plugins, addons, etc in any project, without having to create an entire programming language for it. Plugin / Addon developers don't need to create an entire java project for small things either, making life easier for everyone.
Still WIP, not really usable and doesn't execute yet (working on parser and AST generation).

```
module helloworld {
    
    pub fn main {
        std.println("Hello, world!");
    }

}

```
