# mu-lang

Scripting language designed to communicate with java, to allow for easy plugins, addons, etc in any project, without having to create an entire programming language for it.
Still WIP, not really usable and doesn't execute yet.

`
module helloworld {
    
    pub fn main {
        std.println("Hello, world!");
    }

}
`
